					You've <a href="start.html">deployed</a> BCHS.
					Your editor is open.
					Where do you begin?
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<section>
							<p>
								Be familiar with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875">CGI</a> and <a
									href="http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fcgi-spec.html">FastCGI</a>.
							</p>
							<p class="alt">
								...or...
							</p>
							<p>
								Install and use <a href="http://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi">kcgi</a> or <a
									href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">fcgi</a> from <a
									href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html">packages</a>.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section class="explain">
							<p>
								If you don't want to parse content by hand&#8212;and you really, really don't&#8212;let a
								library do it for you.
								(Want FastCGI?  Think twice.
								CGI scripts run by <a
									href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man8/slowcgi.8">slowcgi(8)</a>
								already have their privileges dropped and file-system constrained.  With
								FastCGI, you'll need to do it yourself.)

								Get to know your security tools.
								OpenBSD has <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man4/systrace.4">systrace(4)</a>.
								FreeBSD has <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=capsicum&amp;sektion=4">capsicum(4)</a>.

								Your application will be under assault every moment it's running.
								And it will have bugs: limit the damage caused by inevitable mistakes by
								constraining (sandboxing) the environment available to your application.
							</p>
						</section>
					</li>

						<section>
							<p>
								Statically scan your binary with <a href="http://www.llvm.org/">LLVM</a>
								(from <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html">packages</a>).
							</p>
						</section>
						<section class="explain">
							<p>
								This static analysis tool can help catch source-level bugs.
								An alternative compiler can also prevent you from relying too much on <a
									href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/c++.1">gcc(1)</a>'s
								extensions, which reduces portability.
							</p>
						</section>
					</li>
					<li>
						<section>
							<p>
								Run your application under <a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> (from <a
									href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html">packages</a>) and make sure
								your <a
									href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/malloc.conf.5">malloc.conf(5)</a>
								flags are unforgiving.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section class="explain">
							<p>
								Memory errors are often the subtlest.
								Use these tools as much as possible to catch any unnoticed allocation issues.
							</p>
						</section>
					</li>

						<section>
							<p>
								Parsing data?
								Push your parsers into libraries and use <a
									href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">AFL</a> (from <a
									href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html">packages</a>) to put them
								through inputs you haven't tested.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section class="explain">
							<p>
								The thought that <q>this input could never happen</q> is your adversary's favourite.
								It <i>will</i> happen.
								Make sure any parsing sequences are being run through as many code-paths as
								possible with this tool.
							</p>
						</section>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Don't forget: BSD is a community of professionals.
					Go to conferences (<a href="http://www.eurobsdcon.org">EuroBSDCon</a>, <a
						href="http://www.asiasbsdcon.org">AsiaBSDCon</a>, <a href="http://www.bsdcan.org">BSDCan</a>,
					etc.).
					Subscribe to the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html">mailing lists</a>.
					<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html">Donate</a>.
					And lastly but most important of all: use the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi">man pages</a>!
